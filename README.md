This is a website for an imagined online shop selling women's and men's outerwear.


## Description

This project has developed through a series of assignments at Noroff, the first one a few weeks into my first design course.

The first two assignment focused on design. I made a style tile with ideas for fonts, colors, buttons etc. The next step was to make a prototype of the page in Adobe XD.

For the project we had received a brief. The target audience was to be men and women aged 30 to 50 whose interests are: being outdoors, hiking, exploring, skiing, camping, canoeing. The unique selling point were the jackets which were mid-range in price, and to emphasize durability and being suitable for a range of different weather types 
ensuring customers are comfortable whatever adventure they go on. Required site architecture was a home page, a checkout page, a checkout success, about, contact, a page listing the jackets, and a jacket specific page showing product details such as the description of the product, price and has an add to cart button. 

Making the prototype I went a bit to far with regards to my skills and experience at that point. I got excited and made the site more complex than what was asked for.

This followed me through the rest of the project, where I strugled to finnish everything I had set out to do. After learning some project management I realized how I could have planned and managed better, and set realistic goals for myself.

The next assignment was to create the website using HTML and CSS. I had to consider responsiveness as well as trying to apply what I had learned about semantics in HTML and layout using flex in CSS.

After that we had an assignment where we used headless cms to populate the site with products. Working on the site again after a few months made me struck with how frustrating it is to work with badly written code.

Some points I learned from working on this project:

- The importance of good project management
- Responsiveness starts at the design stage, it's not something you can add last minute
- Writing clean code is necessary for when you or someone else wants to work on the project later on
- Cutting corners to meet the deadline doesn't pay off in the long run

## Built With
